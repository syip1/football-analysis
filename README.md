# football-analysis
A project to predict football match results.
I collected player rating data from SoFIFA (FIFA 21) and Premier League match results in the 2020-21 season from the Premier League website. Then I tried to use various models to predict the outcomes of matches.
football_get_match_results.ipynb: scrapes data (including score, formation and lineup) from the Premier League website. This is stored in matches.csv.
football_get_rating.ipynb: scrapes data (including name, club, position and rating) from the SoFIFA website. This is stored in ratings.csv.
